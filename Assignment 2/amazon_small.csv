characters. easily create characters and objects. use layering behaviors that are similar to other design programs. a wealth of tools at your fingertips. using keyframes and a timeline test your

choose from many built-in characters to grease your animation wheels and get a feel for the software's capabilities. this program includes everything aspiring artists need to create top quality animations from start to finish -- it simplifies the animation process and empowers artists to create their projects faster and easier than ever before. you'll be surprised by how quickly you can get started. packed with ready-to-use anime style characters you can create your own animations right out of the box. tutorials and sample files show you how to maximize anime studio pro's powerful features giving you the jump start you'll need to begin your first project. once you feel at home with the mechanics of the software you'll be ready to move on to your own art. sketch your original characters and backdrops scan in and import graphics or if you use a pen tablet you can recreate the sensation of drawing on paper. built with vector graphics anime studio pro 5 provides power and flexibility with multiple layering and the capacity to resize images without sacrificing quality. another powerful element of anime studio pro 5 is the use of bones. using the software's bone rigging system you can add a skeleton to any image to bring it to life. with anime studio pro 5 there is no need to create new art for each individual frame as you animate -- just adjust the bones to your desired position and the program will generate the movement for you. you can also count on anime studio pro 5 to help direct your animated action with an intuitive timeline. setting your movements to a timeline makes scene changes feel seamless and natural so the plot of your animated short is easier to follow. no animation is complete without an audio soundtrack. anime studio pro 5 helps you add emotion and style to your animations by adding sound in wav and aiff formats. and once you've completed a project you can publish your results for a variety of media including video tv and web formats. design and layout anime studio pro 5 gives you total control over your canvas and makes it easy for you to organize and complete your project using layers. with this intuitive software under your belt you can set up your 2d canvas to the exact dimensions you want. and with anime studio pro you can even turn your canvas into a 3d stage with x y and z coordinates to easily produce your animation with added depth and dimension. using anime studio pro's vector-based graphics you can freely adjust canvas resolution and size without losing image quality. if you're already accustomed to other graphics-driven programs such as photoshop or quark you'll be pleased with anime studio pro's familiar layer-based workflow. it is an easy and efficient way to organize your assets and create your animation and you'll save time by reusing your art. simply create an asset once and place it on a layer then refer to that layer any time you need to reuse a piece of art. advanced layer features include switch layers which allows you to rotate among all the layers in a set and shows only one layer a time. this saves you a great deal of time when animating body movements or facial expressions. use anime studio pro to rig your characters objects and scenes with the revolutionary bone system that makes the animation process easier than ever before. bones create a skeleton that determines joints or flex points in your artwork. you can then manipulate the bones to move the image into new positions without time-consuming redraws. simple tools let you design dynamic character movement. stop thinking of your drawings as fixed static images -- with anime studio pro you drawings become like soft rubber with stiff wires inside that help you move and position the objects on the screen. bones are never displayed in the final render they're just used as a tool during the animation process. and to make the process smoother and easier to follow you can organize your project using keyframe animation and a timeline. then all you need to do is position your image on the canvas and manipulate the timeline. the software will interpolate the motion between positions for you to create a smooth-flowing graceful transition from one movement to the next. in anime studio pro you can also fine tune your animations with powerful timeline controls such as onion skins tweening and graph mode. and with the pro version you can create animations of any length. once you complete a project you can finish it for web tv film and still formats. with anime studio pro you can output your finished work to a variety of standard formats such as avi mov and flash (swf export for vector based animations). studio pro also makes it easy to transfer your work to other popular graphics programs to utilize assets for other projects or to add color to your art. pro exports to jpg bmp png an tga file formats and even allows you to export your artwork as layered psd files. animation techniques traditional animation was created by drawing frames one after another each frame drawn slightly different from the last. anime studio pro helps you simulate frame-by-frame animation yet drastically reduces the time required from traditional animation. designed to mimic real skeletal structure the anime studio pro bones are interdependent so when you adjust one bone all the other connected bones will move in response. the bone-rigging feature also uses spring-like simulation to calculate dynamic bone movement. this makes a wide range of movements seem real such as jumping waving flabby body parts and bouncing hair. you can also take advantage of anime studio pro's switch layers function to work with a combination of connected movements that occur along a timeline. this is particularly valuable for animating body movements or facial expressions such as lip-synch animations when each graphical layer can be a mouth shape for a different sound. an additional animation feature includes cycling keyframe interpolation which will automatically cycle a section of animation and repeat it over again as many times as you wish. another feature includes onion skins that show

b00022pti4,microsoft windows xp professional full version with sp2,with windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 you get safer browsing and communication powerful security tools and improved experiences. windows xp is the operating system release that unifies the microsoft range with all the desktop versions now built on the nt/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of windows 95 98 and me. that makes xp a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and me line but for those already on windows 2000 professional it is a closer call. despite the similar name there is no special synergy between windows xp and office xp which works fine on windows 2000. the security center lets you check the status of your essential security settings. xp certainly looks different with rounded window corners larger and more detailed icons and a clean-look desktop that on first installation shows only the taskbar and recycle bin. xp is also more customizable than earlier versions of windows and includes visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of windows in an instant. that is the window-dressing but underneath are some significant improvements. one of the most interesting is remote desktop. a standard xp feature this uses technology from microsoft terminal server to enable users to access their computer over any connection; for example by dialing into the office from home. this is not just file access--this technology lets you run applications remotely as if you were sitting at your desk at work. this is mature technology stable and carefully thought out. so for example you can print from a remote word processor to a local printer. a variation on the theme is remote assistance where the user can allow a remote helper to view their desktop or optionally gain control of the keyboard and mouse in order to troubleshoot a problem. the feature can also be disabled to ease security concerns. laptop users benefit from enhanced power management with options to extend battery life by reducing cpu speed and display brightness. irda support has been fixed so that unlike windows 2000 windows xp can easily use modems in mobile telephones via infrared. a new screen font cleartype improves legibility for laptop or other flat screens and there is built-in support for wireless networking using the popular 802.11 standard. a great feature of xp also found in windows 2000 is the ability to synchronize network files with offline copies. previously these files could not be stored securely but now they can be encrypted. the information bar in windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 notifies you when it blocks activex control or active content and then lets you decide what to do. for web browsing xp comes with internet explorer 6.0. the enhancements in ie 6.0 are mainly of interest to web developers and in any case microsoft makes ie freely available to all windows users. although java is not installed by default it is not difficult to download a java virtual machine (jvm). windows messenger originally a chat client has evolved into a collaboration tool that allows for video conferencing and application sharing. service pack 2 allows users to instruct internet explorer how to handle downloads from a specific publisher the most significant new feature for internet users is the built-in firewall. a firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online reading private files or causing other damage. xp's built-in firewall is a simple affair but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connection. windows xp has strong multimedia features. the new media player lets you copy music from cd to hard disk create your own playlist and write your own music cds if you have a cd writer. although there is loss of quality as a result of compression the process is easy and convenient. media player 8.0 can play back dvd video but only if a hardware or software dvd decoder is already installed. you can also play mp3 audio files and mpeg videos but sadly not the popular realmedia formats. in the end media player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives but it is slick and nicely integrated. the xp user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of windows but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. the start menu now automatically features the most frequently used programs at the top of the list and you can add and remove shortcuts by right-clicking the icon and selecting pin or unpin from the pop-up menu. windows online help is integrated into a help and support center that works like an internal web site with searchable help tutorials and walk-throughs. windows xp professional includes all the features of windows xp home and adds support for dual processors encryptable file systems offline folders the remote desktop as described above and extra administration features that come into play when connected to a windows server domain. xp is demanding on hardware and it would be a mistake to install it on less than microsoft's recommended minimum requirements. there is also activation to consider a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure that requires you to obtain a code from microsoft for full installation and in the future if you reinstall or make major system changes. windows xp service pack 2 features internet explorer pop-up blocker makes browsing the internet more enjoyable by enabling you to reduce unwanted ads and content. internet explorer download monitoring warns you about potentially harmful downloads and gives you the option to block files that could be malicious. internet explorer information bar provides better information about events that are happening as you browse the web so it& 8217;s easier to know what& 8217;s going on and address potential security issues. windows security center allows you to easily view your security status and manage key security settings in one convenient place. windows firewall update automatically turned on by default this improved firewall helps protect windows xp from viruses worms and other security threats that can spread over the internet. improved wireless support dramatically improves and simplifies the process of discovering and connecting to wireless networks. bluetooth technologies enables you to easily connect to the latest bluetooth-enabled hardware devices such as keyboards cell phones and pdas. windows media player 9 series makes it easy to enjoy music video and broadband content with enhanced security.,microsoft,299.99
